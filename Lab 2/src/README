Operating Systems Lab 2 README

The source code consists of three java files and requires Java 1.8.* in order to run.
Scheduler.java is the main file that needs to run.

***
In the working directory (RR-LAB-2), use the following commands:
-> javac *.java //3 class files should appear in directory
-> java <program-name> <input-filename> OR -> java <program-name> --verbose <input-filename>

If successful, console will print the expected outputs for the four algorithms in order.
If not successful, console will log the error that occurred (regarding formatting of input/file read).

It is expected that random-numbers is a valid file in the working directory.

Errors include:
-Input file not found or could not be read
-General format of input file is not correct

***
Descriptions of Classes created:
-The RandomBurst class parses the random-numbers file for each algorithm.

-The Process class creates an Process that uses the parsed information from input-file to create the schedulers.

-The SortByRemainder class is a comparator that is used to sort Processes based off of their remaining total CPU time.

Note: These classes are not private for the sake of accessing data fields immediately rather than calling methods. The classes are instead package-private by default.
There are no individual classes for each algorithm, in order to make calling each algorithm easier.
